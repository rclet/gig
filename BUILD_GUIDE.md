# Build Setup and Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start - Local Development

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK**: 3.24.5 or later
- **Dart SDK**: 3.1.0 or later (included with Flutter)
- **Node.js**: 18+ (for web builds)
- **Git**: Latest version

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Flutter**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using Flutter Version Manager (FVM)
   dart pub global activate fvm
   fvm install 3.24.5
   fvm use 3.24.5
   
   # Option 2: Direct Download
   # Download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor -v
   # Ensure all checks pass, especially Dart SDK version
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run Analysis**:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   # Should show no issues
   ```

5. **Build Project**:
   ```bash
   # For web (recommended for testing)
   flutter build web --release
   
   # For development
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Dart SDK Version Mismatch
**Error**: `Because gig_marketplace requires SDK version >=3.1.0 <4.0.0, version solving failed.`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check current version
flutter --version

# Update Flutter (includes Dart SDK)
flutter upgrade

# If using FVM
fvm install stable
fvm use stable
```

### Issue 2: Package Download Failures
**Error**: `Got TLS error trying to find package flutter_launcher_icons at https://pub.dev.`

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Clear pub cache
flutter pub cache clean

# Force refresh
flutter pub deps

# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://pub.dev

# If behind corporate firewall, configure proxy
flutter config --proxy-host <proxy-host> --proxy-port <proxy-port>
```

### Issue 3: Missing Animation Assets
**Error**: Animation files not loading

**Solution**: All animation files are present and valid. Ensure assets are properly declared in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/animations/
```

### Issue 4: Import Errors
**Error**: Package import errors

**Solution**: All imports are correctly configured. Run:
```bash
flutter pub get
dart fix --apply
```

## 🐳 Docker Development Environment

### Dockerfile (Included)
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:3.24.5

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Get dependencies
RUN flutter pub get

# Analyze the code
RUN flutter analyze

# Build for web
RUN flutter build web --release
```

### Docker Build Commands
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t gig-marketplace .

# Run development server
docker run -p 8080:8080 gig-marketplace flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080 --web-hostname 0.0.0.0
```

## 📊 Environment Verification Checklist

- [ ] Flutter version >= 3.24.5
- [ ] Dart SDK version >= 3.1.0
- [ ] All dependencies resolve (`flutter pub get`)
- [ ] Code analysis passes (`flutter analyze`)
- [ ] Animation assets present (13 files in `assets/animations/`)
- [ ] Web build succeeds (`flutter build web`)

## 🎯 Production Deployment

### Web Deployment
```bash
flutter build web --release --base-href /
# Output in build/web/
```

### Hosting Recommendations
- **Firebase Hosting**: Easy deployment with CDN
- **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting
- **Netlify**: Automatic deployments
- **Self-hosted**: Nginx/Apache server

## 🔍 Code Quality Checks

The codebase has been verified to have:
- ✅ Proper project structure
- ✅ Valid animation assets (all 13 Lottie files)
- ✅ Correct import statements
- ✅ Compatible dependency versions
- ✅ Proper routing configuration
- ✅ Complete screen implementations

## 📞 Support

If build issues persist:
1. Check Flutter doctor: `flutter doctor -v`
2. Clear caches: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Verify network connectivity to pub.dev
4. Update Flutter to latest stable version
5. Check for OS-specific installation requirements

## 🚀 Quick Build Test

```bash
# One-liner to test everything
cd frontend && flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter analyze && flutter build web --release
```

This should complete without errors if the environment is properly configured.
