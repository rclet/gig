## Coding Standards

### Backend (Laravel/PHP)

- Follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comprehensive PHPDoc comments
- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Use type hints and return types
- Write tests for new functionality

Example:
```php
<?php

/**
 * Create a new job posting.
 *
 * @param array $jobData The job data to create
 * @return Job The created job instance
 * @throws ValidationException If validation fails
 */
public function createJob(array $jobData): Job
{
    $validatedData = $this->validateJobData($jobData);
    
    return Job::create($validatedData);
}
```

### Frontend (Flutter/Dart)

- Follow [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful widget and variable names
- Write comprehensive documentation comments
- Follow Flutter conventions and best practices
- Use proper state management patterns
- Write tests for widgets and logic

Example:
```dart
/// A widget that displays a job card with basic information.
///
/// This widget shows the job title, company, budget, and other
/// essential details in a card format suitable for list views.
class JobCard extends StatelessWidget {
  /// Creates a job card widget.
  const JobCard({
    super.key,
    required this.job,
    this.onTap,
  });

  /// The job data to display.
  final Job job;

  /// Callback when the card is tapped.
  final VoidCallback? onTap;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Backend Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd backend
php artisan test
```

Write tests for:
- API endpoints
- Models and relationships
- Services and business logic
- Database operations

### Frontend Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd frontend
flutter test
```

Write tests for:
- Widget functionality
- State management
- API integration
- User interactions

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if needed
- Add inline code documentation
- Update API documentation
- Include examples for new features

## Performance Considerations

### Backend
- Use database indexing appropriately
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Optimize database queries
- Use queues for heavy operations

### Frontend
- Optimize widget rebuilds
- Use proper list view builders for large datasets
- Implement image caching
- Minimize network requests

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
